# fabric-client-template (intellij)
This is a simple fabric client with absolutely nothing implemented and should be used as a base for ones own projects. I made this repository after struggling to get my project off the ground due to gradle issues, so I thought I would make this. If you have any other resources that you think might be useful, create an issue and I will gladly add it to this repository.

## What to do
- Clone this repository locally to your machine
- Open the project in intellij
- Once this project is open, open the gradle tab on the top right of your screen. Once that is open you should see a wrench icon. Click this and press gradle settings. From there change the JVM version from whatever you have it as to a version of JDK 16.
  - JDK 16 can be downloaded from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk16-archive-downloads.
